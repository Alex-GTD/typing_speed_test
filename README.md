# Typing speed test

A Python typing training application that I created while studying the development of the Tkinter GUI.

## What does it do
- Generates random words for typing practice
- Tracks your speed and accuracy in real time
- Saves your high score between sessions

## Why did I create it
I created this project to:
- Practice GUI development in Python
- Learn about file processing (saving results)
- I understand event-based programming
- Improve my typing skills!

## Project structure
```
Typing speed test/
─── application / # The main application code
,── Resources / # Images and Icons
,── data / # Word list and score storage
,── graphic интерфейс.ру # User interface of the user
,── logic.py # Basic functionality
─── main.py # Entry point
└── requirements.txt # Dependencies
``

## Try it out
1. Clone the repository:
`clone bash
git clone https://github.com/Alex-GTD/TypingSpeedTest.git typing speed test on
CD
```

2. Create a virtual environment:
